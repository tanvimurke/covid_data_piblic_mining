    "### Question 1: Text cleaning and tokenization\n",
    "Implement the three functions `clean_string`, `tokenize` and `lemmatize` that perform the following text preprocessing tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `clean_text` should:\n",
    "    * convert the string to lower case.\n",
    "    * remove any instance of `'s` that is either followed by any whitespace character, or at the end of the string: `teacher's help` becomes `teacher help`, and `children's` becomes `children`.\n",
    "    * remove apostrophe character `'`: `don't` becomes `dont`. For simplicity we will only consider the character `'` as apostrophe (so `’` is not).\n",
    "    * remove leading and trailing space.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `tokenize` should:\n",
    "    * use `nltk.word_tokenize` to tokenize the input text.\n",
    "    * further break tokens at characters which are not digits 0-9 and not present in `string.ascii_letters`. For example, `a_b_c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`.\n",
    "    * maintain the token order as it appears in the original string.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `lemmatize` should:\n",
    "    * lemmatize each token individually.\n",
    "    * remove tokens that are stopwords or contain fewer than two characters (these two cases should be checked after the lemmatization step).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "* When lemmatizing a word, you should also specify the part-of-speech `pos` parameter. This can be obtained by calling `nltk.pos_tag` and using the first returned tag (in case there are multiple possibilities). You can interpret the returned tag as follows:\n",
    "    * If it starts with \"J\", it is an adjective.\n",
    "    * If it starts with \"V\", it is a verb.\n",
    "    * If it starts with \"R\", it is an adverb.\n",
    "    * Otherwise, it is a noun.\n",
    "* `nltk.pos_tag` should be called on each individual token, instead of on the entire tokenized text. For example, if the input string is `\"learning is fun\"`, you should call `nltk.pos_tag([\"learning\"])` to get the part-of-speech of `'learning'`, and input that to the lemmatizer. You may notice that in this case `\"learning\"` is classified as a verb (while it is a noun in the original sentence). However, this is not a problem, since our end goal is to reduce each token to its base form, not to correctly classify its part-of-speech.\n",
    "* If you use the regex character set `\\w`, note that it matches alphanumeric characters **and** the underscore character `_`."

    "    'Summary': '.....' #str, the summary div between the title and author fields, or empty string if no summary is available\n",
    "    'Content': '.....' #list, the whole article content, where every element is a paragraph (i.e., comes from a <p> tag)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of `Summary` and `Content` should be raw texts that do not contain any HTML tag. For example, if the input HTML code is `\"<p><b>Hello</b><a href=\"https://google.com\">World</a><p>\"` then the output `Content` should be `\"Hello World\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the local test we have provided the full reference JSON files for some article pages. If your dictionary does not match the reference JSON, you should print out both and do a careful comparison to see where the difference is.\n",

    "**Notes**:\n",
    "* Occasionally there are some \"Related\" blocks embedded in the article text (example [here](http://clouddatascience.blob.core.windows.net/m20-foundation-data-science/p3-domain-data-preparation/nature_related.png)). These are characterized by the attribute `data-label=\"Related\"` and should **not** be included in the parsing result.\n",
    "* The `Published Date` field should be the original article date, not the updated date. For example, the `Published Date` for [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20210308142952/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00166-6) is 2020-01-22.\n",
    "* Remember to call `strip()` on all values in the returned dictionary so that there is no leading or trailing space anywhere. If a content paragraph becomes empty after `strip()`, it should not be included. You do not need to call any other text processing task in section A.\n",
    "* Do not parse information form the `meta` tags as they are not robust. Every required information can be found within `body`.\n",
    "* If an article has no authors (e.g., [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20201116084933/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00589-1)), the Author field should be an empty list.\n",
    "* For the Content list, only text contents that come from the `p` tags in the article body should be included. You can start by identifying a `div` that corresponds to the entire article body (looking at the CSS class names may be helpful). Note that if an image caption is the child of a `p` tag, its content should be included as well."
